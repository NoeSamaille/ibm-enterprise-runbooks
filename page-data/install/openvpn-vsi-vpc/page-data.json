Copy `terraform.tfvars.template` to `terraform.tfvars`:\n   ```sh\n   cp terraform.tfvars.template terraform.tfvars\n   ```\n1. Edit `terraform.tfvars` to match your environment.\n1. Use the [following Docker image](https://github.com/l2fprod/ibmcloud-ci) to run the deployment scripts. It has all required tools preinstalled.\n   * On Linux terminal:\n      ```\n      docker run -it --volume $PWD:/root/mnt/home --workdir /root/mnt/home l2fprod/ibmcloud-ci\n      ```\n   * On Windows command prompt:\n      ```\n      docker run -it --volume %CD%:/root/mnt/home --workdir /root/mnt/home l2fprod/ibmcloud-ci\n      ```\n   You can also try with your own environment. Prereqs are: tfswitch, terraform, ansible, ssh.\n1. Run `tfswitch` to point to the right Terraform version for this solution:\n   ```\n   tfswitch\n   ```\n1. Deploy all resources:\n   ```sh\n   terraform init\n   terraform apply\n   ```\n\n## Install OpenVPN on the bastion\n\n1. Change to ansible directory:\n   ```\n   cd ansible\n   ```\n1. Install ansible dependencies\n   ```\n   ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml\n   ```\n1. To confirm ansible configuration, ping all hosts\n   ```\n   ansible all -m ping -i inventory -v\n   ```\n1. Install OpenVPN on the bastion\n   ```\n   ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook-openvpn.yml\n   ```\n\n## Connect to OpenVPN\n\nTo connect to the VPN, use _OpenVPN Connects_ with the configuration generated in `ansible/client-config/mymachine`:\n- https://openvpn.net/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/\n- https://openvpn.net/client-connect-vpn-for-mac-os/\n\nor from a command line\n   ```\n   openvpn --setenv FORWARD_COMPATIBLE 1 --daemon --config ./client-config/mymachine/*-bastion.ovpn\n   ```\n\nTo view routes on macOS, use `netstat -nr`. On Linux and Windows `netstat -ar`.\n\n## Test the OpenVPN connection\n\nFrom the Docker container, ping one VPC server instance directly from your local machine:\n```\nping $(terraform output -json | jq -r '.instance_ips.value[0]')\n```\n\nor a COS direct endpoint:\n```\nping s3.direct.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud\n```\n\nor a service private endpoint:\n```\nping api.private.us-south.speech-to-text.watson.cloud.ibm.com\n```\n\nIf you stop the VPN connection, all these ping would fail.\n\n## Destroy all configuration\n\n1. To destroy the environment, from the Docker container use:\n   ```sh\n   terraform destroy\n   ```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"04d7515811cbc215429f8d1e20f3573d","counter":687,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":""},"exports":{},"rawBody":"# Use OpenVPN to access virtual server instances running in a virtual private cloud\n\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC) come with an additional layer of security as your workload can be completely hidden from the public Internet.
