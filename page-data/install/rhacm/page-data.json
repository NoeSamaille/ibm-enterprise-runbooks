As a result, you registered your cluster as well as installed Redhat Marketplace Opertor.\n\n![Redhat Marketplace Cluster](/images/rhmclusters.png)\n\n## Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes\n\nThe Red Hat Marketplace offers a wide variety of products across 12 categories. As an example, let’s say that you want to try out Redhat Advanced Cluster Management.\n\n![OpenShift Operator Install ](/images/rhacmsearch.png)\n\nCreate a project and name it \"rh-acm-demo\" in your IBM Cloud ROKS cluster.\n\n### Buy the software\n\nGo to the Marketplace catalog and search for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. Select the correct tile and click on Free trial to start your 30-day trial, as shown in figure below\n\n![OpenShift Operator Install ](/images/rhacmbuy.png)\n\nGo to Workspace > click the My Software, which is shown in figure below\n\n![OpenShift Operator Install ](/images/mysoftware.png)\n\n### Install the software\n\nGo to Workspace > My Software and click the Install Operator icon, which is shown in figure below\n\n![OpenShift Operator Install ](/images/InstallOperator.png)\n\n### Install the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for your free trial\n\nSelect the IBM Cloud ROKS cluster from the list of target clusters, then pick the namespace scope where you want to install the Operator, as shown in figure below\n\n![OpenShift Operator Install ](/images/selectns.png)\n\n### Verify the operator installation\nClick the My Software / Red Hat Advanced Cluster and select the Operators Tab\n\n![OpenShift Operator Install ](/images/rhacmverify.png)\n\nLog in to the cluster to verify that the Operator installed successfully, as shown in figure belowrhc\n\n![OpenShift Operator Install ](/images/clusterverify.png)\n\n### OperatorHub - OpenShift Console\n\nYou can install OpenShift Operators directly from the cluster. Red Hat Marketplace Operators become available in the OperatorHub after you install the Marketplace Operator.
