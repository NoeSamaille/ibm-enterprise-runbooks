Install a lightweight k3s cluster on a VPC Node**\n\n### **(A) Create a VPC vpc-edge**\n\nUse IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud to create your own space in IBM Cloud. A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\nYou can create and configure an IBM Cloud™ Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by using the IBM Cloud console.\n\n#### **1. Create VPC Instances**\n\n- Create a generation 2 virtual server instance. \n- Create a VPC and subnet to define the network. When you create your subnet, attach a public gateway if you want to allow all resources in the subnet to communicate with the public internet.\n\n![IBM Cloud VPC Edge](images/newvpc.png)\n\n\n#### **2. Create Subnet**\n\n- To limit the subnet's inbound and outbound traffic, you can configure an access control list (ACL). By default, all traffic is allowed.\n\n\n![IBM Cloud VPC Subnet](images/newvpcsubnet.png)\n\n#### **3. Reserve IP**\n\n- If you want your instance to be reachable from the internet, reserve and associate a floating IP address.\n\n![IBM Cloud VPC IP Range](images/iprange.png)\n\n#### **4. Next Steps**\n\nYou are ready to connect to your instance. \n\n### **(B) Create a edge-node1 virtual machine (virtual server) within the VPC**\n\nIBM Cloud Virtual Servers for Virtual Private Cloud give you access to all of the benefits of IBM Cloud VPC, including network isolation, security, and flexibility.\n\n- You can create IBM Cloud™ Virtual Servers for Virtual Private Cloud from the Virtual server instances page in IBM Cloud console.\n\n#### **1. Creating Virtual Server (VS) instance**\n\nIn IBM Cloud console External link icon, navigate to Menu icon Menu icon > VPC Infrastructure > Compute > Virtual server instances.\n\nClick New instance and enter the following information as shown in the diagram:\n\n![IBM Cloud VPC Edge](images/newvpcvs.png)\n\n#### **2. Stock Images**\n\nWhen you provision IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for Virtual Private Cloud, you can select from the supported stock images or a custom image that you import from IBM Cloud Object Storage. The image that you select determines the operating system that is provisioned for your instance. \n\n![IBM Cloud VPC Subnet](images/vpcos.png)\n\n#### **3. Reserving a floating IP address**\n\nYou can reserve and associate a floating IP address to your instance so you can connect to it from an internet location.\n\n![IBM Cloud VPC IP Range](images/vpcvolume.png)\n\n#### **4. Next Steps**\n\nYou are ready to connect to your instance. \n\n### **(C) Login with the ssh key**\n\n- If you need to give others access to vm for others, add public key to the authorized_keys in the vm.\n\n## **Install a edge node with just K3s or docker**\n\nThe following instructions guide you through the process of installing the open source project, K3s or Docker on your edge device and registering it with IBM Edge Application Manager IEAM.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"K3s\">\n\n## Install a edge node with just K3s\n\nThe following instructions guide you through the process of installing the open source project, k3s, which is a lightweight, easy to install Kubernetes distribution geared towards resource-constrained environments and low touch operations on your edge device and registering it with IBM Edge Application Manager IEAM.\n\n```\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -\n```\n\nExecute CLI to verify if k3s is running.\n\n```\nkubectl get nodes \n```\n\n### Installing agent on k3s:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKVV_4.1/devices/installing/preparing_edge_cluster.html\n\n</Tab>\n\n\n<Tab label=\"Docker\">\n\n## Install a edge node with just docker\n\nThe following instructions guide you through the process of installing the docker on your edge device and registering it with IBM Edge Application Manager IEAM.\n\n - Create a VM on VPC (Refer to procedure above)\n - Install docker on ubuntu vm\n\n```\napt-get update\napt-get install docker.io\n```\n\n```\nsystemctl restart docker\n```\n\n - Check to see if docker is running\n```\ndocker images\n```\n\n### Installing agent on docker:\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKVV_4.1/devices/installing/registration.html\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"72a8a2be3f80dd349dc9b43e3371cb1e","counter":802,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Edge Node"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Edge Node \n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## **Overview**\n\nThe certified lightweight Kubernetes distribution built for IoT & Edge computing\n\n## **1.
