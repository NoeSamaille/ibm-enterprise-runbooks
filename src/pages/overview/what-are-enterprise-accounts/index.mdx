## **Introduction**

IBM Cloud enterprises provide a way to centrally manage billing and resource usage across multiple accounts. Within an enterprise, you create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts, with billing and payments for all accounts managed at the enterprise level.

 

When compared to using multiple stand-alone accounts, enterprises offer the following key benefits:

  - Centralized account management: 
      View your entire enterprise hierarchy at a glance, without needing to switch accounts. 
  
  - Consolidated subscription billing: 
        Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view. 
  
  - Top-down usage reporting:
     From your enterprise account, you can view usage of all accounts in your enterprise, which is organized by account group.

### **Enterprise hierarchy**

At its core, an enterprise consists of three main building blocks:

  - The enterprise account, which serves as the parent account to all other accounts in the enterprise.
  
  - Account groups, which you can use to organize related accounts. 
 
  - Accounts, which are just like stand-alone IBM Cloud accounts in that they contain resources and resource groups and independent access permissions.
