## **What are Run Books**


### Overview

This short video introduces the concepts of DevOps with <Globals name="ocp" />:

Each development team installs its own <Globals name="env" /> into the team's account. The environment includes several features that support <Globals name="method" /> best practices for consistent and rapid development of cloud-native applications:

- **Installation**: The <Globals name="shortName"/> is able to install itself as a new <Globals name="env" />
- **Cluster**: A <Globals name="kube" /> or <Globals name="ocp" /> cluster that both hosts the tools and itself is a deployment target for application builds
- **SDLC**: Deployment target environments that support the application development lifecycle: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*
- **Backend services**: Cloud services commonly required by cloud-native applications for monitoring, security, and persistence
- **CI/CD**: A prebuilt, ready-to-run continuous delivery pipeline incorporating best-of-breed open source software tools
- **<Globals name="templates" />**: Prebuilt code templates for common application components and tasks incorporating best practices that developers can add to their codebase as needed
- **Dashboard**: A centralized console to help developers use the environment's capabilities
- **Red Hat CRC**: The tools can be installed into the RedHat CodeReady Containers environment

A core set of tools are sourced from the [IBM Bitnami Software Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label%3Ahelm#software) that can be found in the <Globals name="ic" />. This approach helps assemble these reliable open source development tools into an end-to-end developer experience that is fully integrated with <Globals name="ic" />'s managed container orchestration services.

Typically a Cloud System Admin (such as a [squad leader](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/culture/practice-building-effective-squads/)) installs and sets up a new <Globals name="env" /> after the [initial inception workshop](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception), providing a place for the developers to start developing the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception/practice_minimum_viable_product). The objective is to reduce the time required for a team to configure and prepare their development environment. The key benefit is to make the end-to-end [CI/CD development lifecycle](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/deliver/practice_continuous_delivery/) consistent across each platform and make the out-of-the-box developer experience as simple as possible.

The installation is performed using [Terraform](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform), driven by scripts with a [modular configuration](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules) so unneeded tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. The combination of tools selected are proven in the industry to deliver real value for modern cloud-native development.

[Red Hat Open Innovation Labs CI/CD components](https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-ci-cd) embodies a very similar approach to how they deliver success with OpenShift.

### **Environment components**

After installation, the <Globals name="env" /> consists of the following components and developer tools:
- A development cluster
- A set of backend services
- A set of continuous delivery tools

This diagram illustrates the <Globals name="env" />:

The diagram shows the components in the environment: the cluster, the deployment target environments, the cloud services, and the tools.

#### **Development cluster**

The heart of the <Globals key="env" /> is a cluster:

- An [<Globals key="iks" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service)
or [<Globals key="roks" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift) 3-node cluster
- Cluster namespace that encapsulates the tooling installed in the cluster: *tools*
- Cluster namespaces for deployment target environments: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*
