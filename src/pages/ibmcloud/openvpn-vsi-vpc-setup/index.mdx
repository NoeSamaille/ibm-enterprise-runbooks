### **Solution Architecture:**

![Solution Architecture](/images/solution-architecture.png)

### **Solution Assumption:** 

- It is assumed that the IBM Cloud VPC Network is pre-configured.
- It is assumed that the Transit Gateway has been configured with required connectivity
between VPC infrastructure and Classic Infrastructure.
- A CentOS server is provisioned with 4vCPU / 8GB Memory & 100GB Disk for
configuring OpenVPN server. Hostname for this server is “nativeipvpnserver”.
- We will be a leveraging two VPC one each from Dallas and Sydney multi-zone region.

- Dallas VPC name “daltestvpc” & Sydeny VPC Name “demovpc1”.
- Each zone in Dallas have been auto configured with following Subnet.

    * AZ Dallas1 - 10.240.0.0/18.
    * AZ Dallas2 - 10.240.64.0/18.
    * AZ Dallas3 - 10.240.128.0/18.

- Each zone in Sydney have been auto configured with following Subnet.

    * AZ Sydney1 - 10.245.0.0/18.
    * AZ Sydne2 - 10.245.64.0/18.
    * AZ Sydney3 - 10.245.128.0/18.

- A RedHat server have been configured under each AZ for validating network connectivity from user desktop to resources in each AZ.
- A RedHat OS server have been configured under classic infrastructure in Dallas region for network connectivity validation.
- There are two roles have been assumed for the exercise **Cloud Administrator** and **DevOps User**.
- **Cloud Administrator** will be responsible for implementing OpenVPN Solution and **DevOps user** responsible for managing Applications which is running behind OpenVPN infrastructure.

### **High-Level Implementation Steps:**

1. OpenVPN Solution Implementation.
2. IBM Cloud Security Group Configuration for OpenVPN Infrastructure.
3. Add new VPN User in OpenVPN server.
4. OpenVPN Client Setup & Connectivity Validation.

### **OpenVPN Solution Implementation(Role : Cloud Administrator):**

We will be using a CentOS VSI instance as OpenVPN server for this exercise.

***Step 1:***

Login to **to-be** OpenVPN server **nativeipvpnserver**.
***Step 2:***

Run “yum update -y” command to Update OS packages.

![yumupdate](/images/yumupdate.png)
***Step 3:***

Find out IP Address of OpenVPN server **nativeipvpnserver**. **ip a** gives interface private IP address for OpenVPN Server host.

![ipa](/images/ipa.png)

***Step 4:***

The OpenVPN Server host Public IP (Floating IP) address needs to be find from IBM Cloud Console.

![nativeipvpnserver](/images/nativeipvpnserver.png)

***Step 5:***

OpenVPN server “nativeipvpnserver” Private IP address (10.240.0.4) directly attached to server host and server is behind NAT (Floating IP) with public IP address (52.116.138.238).

***Step 6:***

Download OpenVPN server Management (Install/Config/Manage) script from following location `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angristan/openvpn- install/master/openvpn-install.sh -O centos7-vpn.sh` & change the permission of downloaded script “chmod +x centos7-vpn.sh

![vpnscript](/images/vpnscript.png)

***Step 7:***

Begin OpenVPN server installation by running “centos7-vpn.sh” script.

![hostname](/images/hostname.png)

***Step 8:***

Accent default private IP interface of OpenVPN server “nativeipvpnserver” where OpenVPN services will be listening.

![openvpnservice](/images/openvpnservice.png)

***Step 9:***

Accept NAT ip address which will act as public gateway IP for OpenVPN server.

![openvpnservice](/images/openvpnservice1.png)

***Step 10:***

Disable IPv6 support.

![disableipv6](/images/disableipv6.png)

***Step 11:***

Configure OpenVPN service port number & I would prefer running OpenVPN service with default port number.

![openvpnportno](/images/openvpnportno.png)

***Step 12:***

Configure OpenVPN server port number.

![openvpnportno1](/images/openvpnportno1.png)

***Step 13:***

Configure DNS server settings for OpenVPN server.

![dns](/images/dns.png)

***Step 14:***

Disable compression & recommended to disable this configuration. Press “Enter” to complete OpenVPN Server installation .

![serverinstallation](/images/serverinstallation.png)

***Step 15:***

Configure your first OpenVPN client (Key file) & enter the name of the client. For this exercise I have chosen my first VPN user as “demovpnuser01” and press enter.

![demovpnuser01](/images/demovpnuser01.png)

***Step 16:***

Set a password phrase for VPN Client Key & OpenVPN keys stored under /root/demovpnuser01.ovpn.

![vpnclient](/images/vpnclient.png)

***Step 17:***

Enable OpenVPN server service.

```bash
systemctl enable openvpn-server@server.service
  ```

***Step 18:***

Start OpenVPN service.

```bash
systemctl start openvpn-server@server.service
  ```

***Step 19:***

Validate OpenVPN service status.

![statuscheck](/images/statuscheck.png)

Now, we have successfully completed OpenVPN server installation.

### **IBM Cloud Security Group Configuration for OpenVPN VSI (Role : Cloud Administrator):**


***Step 1:***

Create IBM Cloud security group with following Inbound / Outbound traffic

   * Inbound on port number 1194.
   * Outbound Traffic `All`

***Step 2:***

Login to IBM Cloud & `Create` new security group `openvpnsg`.

![security-group](/images/security-group.png)

***Step 3:***

Add new Inbound rule with OpenVPN Service port number 1194 as below.

![createsecuritygroup](/images/createsecuritygroup.png)

***Step 4:***

Create Outbound rule as blow.

![outbound](/images/outbound.png)

***Step 5:***

Allocate security `openvpnsg` to OpenVPN VSI hosts `nativeipvpnserver` network interface.

![openvpnsg](/images/openvpnsg.png)

Now Security group have been successfully created and assigned to OpenVPN VSI hosts `nativeipvpnserver`.

### **Add new VPN User in OpenVPN server (Role : Cloud Administrator):**

In this section we will show you how to add a new users/Client to OpenVPN server.

***Step 1:***

Login to OpenVPN server VSI instance and execute **centos7-vpn.sh** script which was downloaded during **OpenVPN Server Setup** phase.

![serversetup1](/images/serversetup1.png)

***Step 2:***

From the menu select Option-1 to add new user and press enter.

![serversetup2](/images/serversetup2.png)

***Step 3:***

Enter the name of the client (user name) for new OpenVPN client key. In this example I am creating a user call `demouser02` & protect this Client key with a password.

![serversetup3](/images/serversetup3.png)

***Step 4:***

New client key `demouser02.ovpn` have been successfully created and stored under /root directory.

![serversetup4](/images/serversetup4.png)

***Step 5:***

This OVPN file needs to be shared with user for authenticating with VPN server for accessing resources in VPC and Classic infrastructure.


### **Install OpenVPN Client & Authenticate to OpenVPN Server in IBM Cloud (Role : DevOps):**

***Step 1:***

Install OpnVPN client in user desktop. [OpenVPN client can be found](https://tunnelblick.net/).

***Step 2:***

Start OpenVPN Client (Tunnelblick). 

![Tunnelblick](/images/Tunnelblick.png)

**Note:** I am testing this from my MacBook

***Step 3:***

The OpenVPN Client window looks like below. 

![clientwindow](/images/clientwindow.png)


***Step 4:***

Add VPN key from your desktop to OpenVPN client by `drag-drop` under `Configurations` tab. As soon as user drop the VPN key file under configuration tab, user will be prompted to share this key with `All users` or `Only Me` option. 

![configurationwindow](/images/configurationwindow.png)

***Step 5:***

Once the OVPN key is successfully added to OpenSec VPN client and user should be getting following confirmation screen.

![configurationwindow1](/images/configurationwindow1.png)

***Step 6:***

VPN client is ready to authenticate with OpenVPN server. Select `Connect` button from above screen. Once VPN Client authenticate with OpenVPN server then the user should be able to see `Connected Success` message screen as below.

![configurationwindow2](/images/configurationwindow2.png)

***Step 7:***

Now user is successfully connected to OpenVPN server in IBM Cloud and user should be able to access the Server resources under VPC & Classic Infrastructure over Private IP. Lets quick validate the connectivity from DevOps user laptop

***Step 8:***

Below are the list of server available under various Subnets in VPC “daltestvpc” in Dallas MZR.

![daltestvpc](/images/daltestvpc.png)

***Step 9:***

Lets Ping the IP Address of the servers in Dallas VPC.

![daltestvpc1](/images/daltestvpc1.png)

***Step 10:***

Bello are the list of Devices available under Classic Infra Network & lets quickly validate network connectivity to this thru VPN tunnel using **ping** command..

![daltestvpc2](/images/daltestvpc2.png)


We have successfully Setup OpenVPN infrastructure for Accessing VPC & Classic Infrastructure resources.
