## Introduction

An access group can be created to organize a set of users and service IDs into a single entity that makes it easy for you to assign access. You can assign a single policy to the group instead of assigning the same access multiple times per individual user or service ID.

## CLASSIC INFRASTRUCTURE PERMISSIONS
Classic infrastructure resources have its own policy model and do not support access groups. Specifically, classic infrastructure permissions are assigned per user. However, a set of classic infrastructure permissions for viewing and managing billing information and working with support
cases are now migrated to access groups. As a result, this set of classic infrastructure permissions can be managed by using IAM access control policies. See section below for more information on IAM access control policies.
The permission sets for classic infrastructure are:
    - No access
    - View only
    - Basic user
    - Super user
An account owner has full access to classic infrastructure services and devices. The following diagram shows how classic infrastructure permissions are assigned per user.

## MANAGING USER ACCESS
IBM Cloud IAM consists of a few interrelated components including users, resources, policies, roles, actions, and the Cloud IAM control system. The IAM control system allows users to take actions on resources within an account. The following diagram depicts how IBM Cloud IAM works in an IBM Cloud account. For more information about the diagram, please refer to IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management documentation.
