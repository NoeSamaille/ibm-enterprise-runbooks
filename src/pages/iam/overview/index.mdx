IAM Overview

</PageDescription>

## Introduction

AM enables you to securely authenticate users for platform services and control access to resources consistently across IBM Cloud. A set of IBM Cloud services are enabled to use IBM Cloud IAM for access control, and are organized into resource groups within your account so you can give users quick and easy access to more than one resource at a time. You can use IBM Cloud IAM access policies to assign users and service IDs access to the resources within your account. You can group users and service IDs into an access group to easily give all entities within the group the same level of access.
