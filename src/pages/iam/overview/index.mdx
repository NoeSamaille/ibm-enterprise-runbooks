## Introduction

IAM enables you to securely authenticate users for platform services and control access to resources consistently across IBM Cloud. A set of IBM Cloud services are enabled to use IBM Cloud IAM for access control, and are organized into resource groups within your account so you can give users quick and easy access to more than one resource at a time. 

- You can use IBM Cloud IAM access policies to assign users and service IDs access to the resources within your account. 

- You can group users and service IDs into an access group to easily give all entities within the group the same level of access.

It provides a high-level overview of the IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) on IBM Cloud. It touches on the use of IBMid to provide identity management and the use of infrastructure, platform and service permissions to provide role-based access control to resources on the IBM Cloud. It concludes with an example showing the permissions that are granted to a Red Hat OpenShift user when the IBM Cloud IAM roles are applied to the corresponding Red Hat OpenShift role and resources permissions.

This section assumes readers have some basic understanding of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).
