## **Introduction**

You can use the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA service to track how users and applications interact with an IBM CloudÂ® account, the IBM Cloud catalog, private catalogs, and with IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM).

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA service to track how users and applications interact with the IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service in IBM Cloud.

IAM enables you to securely authenticate users for both platform services and control access to resources consistently across IBM Cloud. Learn more.

The IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA service records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. To get started monitoring your user's actions, see IBM Cloud Activity Tracker with LogDNA. An initiator can be a user, a service, or an application.
