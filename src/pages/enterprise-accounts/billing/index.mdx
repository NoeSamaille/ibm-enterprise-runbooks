## Introduction
In an enterprise, all billing is managed through the top-level enterprise account.  Enterprises require subscription billing, which means that you purchase a subscription for an amount of credit to spend during the subscription term, and usage is deducted from the subscription credit at a discounted rate.

Enterprises enable you to centrally manage multiple IBM Cloud accounts. Because billing is separate from the individual child accounts and consolidated to the enterprise level, enterprises simplify managing billing, invoicing, and payments for the accounts.

## Enterprise Billing Units - CLI
