## Introduction
In an enterprise, all billing is managed through the top-level enterprise account.  Enterprises require subscription billing, which means that you purchase a subscription for an amount of credit to spend during the subscription term, and usage is deducted from the subscription credit at a discounted rate.

Enterprises enable you to centrally manage multiple IBM CloudÂ® accounts. Because billing is separate from the individual child accounts and consolidated to the enterprise level, enterprises simplify managing billing, invoicing, and payments for the accounts.

## Enterprise Billing Units API 
 -With the Enterprise Billing Unit API, you can manage billing units, billing options, and credit pools for an enterprise

## Enterprise Management API 
 -Create and manage enterprises, account groups, and accounts. 
 -An enterprise is a hierarchical account structure that you can use to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple IBM Cloud accounts.
 -In an enterprise, you can import existing accounts from outside the enterprise or create new accounts within the enterprise, and then organize the accounts by using account groups.
 -To create a multitiered hierarchy, you can nest account groups within an account group
