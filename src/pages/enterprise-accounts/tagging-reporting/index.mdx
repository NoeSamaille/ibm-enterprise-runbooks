## Introduction

  - A resource is anything that you can create from the catalog that is managed by and contained within aresource group. Some examples include apps, service instances, container clusters, storage volumes, and virtual servers. When you add a resource to your account from the catalog, you can assign the resource to a resource group.

  - A resource group is a feature that you use to organize your accountresourcesfor access control and billing purposes. If you're familiar with using Cloud Foundry spaces, think of organizing resources in resource groups similarly to the way you organized resources in spaces. 

  - A resource is anything that can be created, managed, and contained within a resource group. Users aren't added to resource groups. Only resources can be added.

Access to resources is managed by using IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) access control. The services that support the use of IAM roles for access and organization within a resource group are referred to as IAM-enabled services.
