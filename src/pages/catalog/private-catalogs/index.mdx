## **Private Catalog**

Private catalogs provide a way to centrally manage access to products in the IBM Cloud catalog and your own catalogs. You can customize your private catalogs to make specific solutions available to users in your account. By doing so, you can ensure that your catalogs are relevant to your business. 

**Creating a private catalog with all products included**

Complete the following steps to create a catalog that includes all products in the IBM Cloud catalog:

- In the console, go to Manage > Catalogs, and click Create a catalog.
- Enter a name, make sure the Start with all available products in this account option is selected, and click Create. The availability is based on the filters set at the account level on the Settings page.
- Confirm that the catalog includes all products by clicking the catalog name > Manage filters. Then, check that Include all products in the IBM Cloud catalog is selected in Step 1: Select to include or exclude all products in the IBM Cloud catalog.
