## **Register Openshift Cluster with Redhat Marketplace**

To register a cluster, Red Hat Marketplace provides a command that installs the Red Hat Marketplace Operator and updates your global cluster pull secret.

Refer the step by step [instructions](https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/documentation/clusters#register-openshift-cluster-with-red-hat-marketplace). As a result, you registered your cluster as well as installed Redhat Marketplace Opertor.

## **Red Hat Marketplace Operator**

When users purchase software and install operators and applications, Red Hat Marketplace Operator watches for and gets configuration changes and resource updates from Red Hat Marketplace. Once the Operator has the information, it updates your cluster.

## **OpenShift Cluster - OperatorHub**

Discover Operators from the Kubernetes community and Red Hat partners, curated by Red Hat. You can install Operators on your clusters to provide optional add-ons and shared services to your developers. After installation, the Operator capabilities will appear in the Developer Catalog providing a self-service experience.
