## **Plan your cluster for high availability**

Design your standard cluster for maximum availability and capacity for your app with Red Hat® OpenShift® on IBM Cloud™.

Your users are less likely to experience downtime when you distribute your apps across multiple worker nodes, zones, and clusters. Built-in capabilities, like load balancing and isolation, increase resiliency against potential failures with hosts, networks, or apps. Review these potential cluster setups that are ordered with increasing degrees of availability.

### RedHat OpenShift on IBM Cloud High Availability Approaches

1. A **single zone cluster** with multiple worker nodes in a worker pool.
2. A **multizone cluster** that spreads worker nodes across zones within one region.
3. Clusters with public network connectivity: **Multiple clusters** that are set up across zones or regions and that are connected via a global load balancer.

### **1.Single zone cluster**

Single zone clusters can be created in one of the supported single zone cities or multizone metro locations. To improve availability for your app and to allow failover for the case that one worker node is not available in your cluster, add additional worker nodes to your single zone cluster.

Note: VPC clusters are supported only in multizone metro locations. If your cluster must reside in one of the single zone cities, create a classic cluster instead. 

**Additional Information**

**Is my master highly available in a single zone cluster?**

If your cluster is created in a single zone city, the Kubernetes master of your classic cluster is highly available and includes replicas on separate physical hosts for your master API server, etcd, scheduler, and controller manager to protect against an outage such as during a master update. If your cluster resides in one of the multizone metro locations, the master is automatically deployed with three replicas and spread across the zones of the metro.

**How can I protect my workloads against a single zone failure?**

If your single zone cluster is created in one of the multizone metro locations, you can change your single zone cluster to a multizone cluster. In a multizone cluster, your workloads are distributed across worker nodes in different zones. If one zone is not available, your workloads continue to run in the remaining zones.

### **2.Multi zone cluster**

Create a multizone cluster to distribute your workloads across multiple worker nodes and zones, and protect against zone failures with hosts, networks, or apps. If resources in one zone go down, your cluster workloads continue to run in the other zones.

Note: You can create a multizone cluster in one of the supported multizone metro locations only.

**Additional Information**

**Why do I need worker nodes in three zones?**

Distributing your work load across three zones ensures high availability for your app in case one or two zones are not available. You must have your worker nodes spread evenly across all three availability zones to meet the IBM Cloud service level agreement (SLA) for HA configuration. This setup also makes your cluster more cost-efficient.

**How is my OpenShift master set up?**

When you create a cluster in a multizone metro location, a highly available master is automatically deployed and three replicas are spread across the zones of the metro.

### **3.Multiple public clusters connected with a global load balancer**

To protect your app from a master failure or for classic clusters that must reside in one of the supported single zone cities, you can create multiple clusters in different zones within a region and connect them with a global load balancer.

Note: To connect multiple clusters with a global load balancer, the clusters must be set up with public network connectivity.


To balance your workload across multiple clusters, you must set up a global load balancer and add the public IP addresses of your router services or load balancer services to your domain. By adding these IP addresses, you can route incoming traffic between your clusters. For the global load balancer to detect if one of your clusters is unavailable, consider adding a ping-based health check to every IP address. When you set up this check, your DNS provider regularly pings the IP addresses that you added to your domain. If one IP address becomes unavailable, then traffic is not sent to this IP address anymore. However, OpenShift does not automatically restart pods from the unavailable cluster on worker nodes in available clusters. If you want OpenShift to automatically restart pods in available clusters, consider setting up a multizone cluster.

**Additional Information**

**Why do I need 3 clusters in three zones?**

Similar to using 3 zones in multizone clusters, you can provide more availability to your app by setting up three clusters across zones. You can also reduce costs by purchasing smaller machines to handle your workload.

**What if I want to set up multiple clusters across regions?**

You can set up multiple clusters in different regions of one geolocation (such as US South and US East) or across geolocations (such as US South and EU Central). Both setups offer the same level of availability for your app, but also add complexity when it comes to data sharing and data replication. For most cases, staying within the same geolocation is sufficient. But if you have users across the world, it might be better to set up a cluster where your users are so that your users do not experience long waiting times when they send a request to your app.
