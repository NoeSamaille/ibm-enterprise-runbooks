## **OpenShift Backup and Restore**

As an administrator, you might need to follow one or more of the following procedures in order to return your cluster to a working state after several disaster situations, that that might occur with their OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
Velero gives you tools to back up and restore your OpenShift cluster resources and persistent volumes. Velero lets you:
- Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
- Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.
- Replicate your production cluster to development and testing clusters.

In this example we are going to demonstrate Velero with Minio as object storage.

### Clone the Velero repository

```
git clone https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero.git
```

### Install MinIO
```
cd velero
oc apply -f examples/minio/00-minio-deployment.yaml
```

And you should see the output like this:
```
namespace/velero created
deployment.apps/minio created
service/minio created
job.batch/minio-setup created
```
### Expose MinIO

Now, we need to expose the MinIO service outside the cluster, so that the velero CLI can interact with it. In OpenShift, this is pretty simple:
```
oc project velero
oc expose svc minio
```
You should see the following output:
```
route.route.openshift.io/minio exposed
```

You can get the information about the route by running the following command:
```
oc get route minio
```
You should be able to open the URL listed there and log in using user: minio and password: minio123
Install Velero CLI

Next, we need to install the Velero CLI in the local machine. For Mac, run the following command:
```
brew install velero
```

### Create credential file

Next, we need to create the Minio credential file. So create a file named credentials-velero with the following content:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = minio
aws_secret_access_key = minio123
```
### Install Velero

We are finally ready to install Velero. Run the following command:
```
velero install \
    --provider aws \
    --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.0.0 \
    --bucket velero \
    --secret-file ./credentials-velero \
    --use-volume-snapshots=false \
    --backup-location-config region=minio,s3ForcePathStyle="true",s3Url=http://minio.velero.svc:9000
```

And you should see the following output:
```

```

Now, we need to test it.
Create some Kubernetes resources

To test the backup procedure, let’s first create some Kubernetes resources. It doesn’t matter which resource, so I will stick to a simple one: ConfigMap. Run the following script to create an OpenShift project and many ConfigMaps:
```
oc new-project test-backup
for i in {1..20}; do echo Creating ConfigMap $i; oc create configmap cm-$i --from-literal="key=$i"; done
```
The lines above create a new project and 20 ConfigMaps. Run the following command to confirm:
```
oc get configmap
```

### Back up OpenShift

Now, we can test the backup procedure. For simplicity, we are going to back up only the test-backup project, but the same concept applies to any (or all) projects. Run the following command:
```
velero backup create my-backup --include-namespaces test-backup
```
and you will see the following output:
```
Backup request "my-backup" submitted successfully.
Run `velero backup describe my-backup` or `velero backup logs my-backup` for more details.
```
After a few seconds, you can check the backup has completed:
```
velero backup describe my-backup
```
now delete these configmaps: 
```
oc delete configmap cm-{1..20}
```
You can validate by running the following command:
```
oc get configmap
```
It should return no configmap:
```
o resources found in test-backup namespace
```

### Restoring the environment

Let’s now restore the backup that Velero created:
```
velero restore create --from-backup my-backup
```
you will see the following output:
```
Restore request "my-backup-20201022164948" submitted successfully.
Run `velero restore describe my-backup-20201022164948` or `velero restore logs my-backup-20201022164948` for more details.
```
Now, we can check the result:
```
oc get cm
```
And you should see the 20 ConfigMaps restored.
