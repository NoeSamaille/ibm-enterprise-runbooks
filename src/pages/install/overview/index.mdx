## **Introduction**

IBM Cloud Paks are containerized, licensed IBM middleware and open source software components that you can use to modernize, move, and build cloud-native business applications in hybrid and multicloud deployments. By running exclusively on OpenShift and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Cloud Paks are built atop a secure stack and maintain consistency in deployment and behavior across cloud providers. You have greater flexibility to run and manage your workloads securely where you need them: on-premises, off-premises, in a backup provider, and in IBM Cloud.
